## Description

**Zyllow Fire Alert** is designed for role-playing (RP) servers on FiveM. It allows for the detection of weapon fire in the game, which is useful for administrators looking to monitor and manage incidents.

### Key Features:

- **Shot Detection:** Real-time monitoring of weapon fire and recording of the coordinates of detected shots.
- **Administrator Notifications:** Sending notifications to server administrators with the coordinates of the shots.
- **Teleportation:** Functionality allowing administrators to teleport to the shot position by pressing a specific key.
- **Management Command:** `/ShowShoot` command to enable or disable shot detection.
